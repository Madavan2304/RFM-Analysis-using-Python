**Overview**

The RFM Analysis project utilizes Python to categorize customers based on three main criteria—Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)—helping businesses identify customer segments for targeted marketing strategies. The project processes transactional data to calculate RFM scores, then classifies customers into value-based segments such as Champions, Loyalists, At-Risk, and Lost Customers.

**Key Objectives**
* **Calculate RFM Metrics:** Compute Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values to quantify customer engagement.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Classify customers into high, mid, and low-value segments based on RFM scores.
* **Visualize Customer Distribution:** Use various plots to highlight customer segments and analyze RFM value distributions.
  
**Project Workflow**
* **Data Preparation:** Load, clean, and format purchase data, accounting for different date formats.
* **RFM Score Calculation:** Apply custom functions to compute recency, frequency, and monetary metrics.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Assign RFM scores to customers and classify them into segments like Champions and Potential Loyalists.
* **Visualization:** Generate graphs, treemaps, and heatmaps to showcase segment distributions and analyze correlations within high-value customer segments.
  
**Tools and Libraries**
* **Python & Pandas:** Data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Plotly Express & Graph Objects:** Visualization of customer segments and RFM values.
* **Datetime Library:** Date processing for accurate Recency calculations.
  
By segmenting customers based on RFM scores, this project provides actionable insights for customer engagement and retention strategies.
