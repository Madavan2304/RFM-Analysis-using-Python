# RFM-Analysis-using-Python
This project leverages RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis in Python to categorize customers by purchasing behavior. Using RFM scores, it identifies high-value segments, such as "Champions" and "Potential Loyalists," enabling targeted marketing strategies. Visualizations and correlation analysis provide insights into customer value.
